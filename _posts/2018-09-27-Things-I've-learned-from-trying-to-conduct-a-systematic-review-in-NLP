title: Things I've learned from trying to conduct a systematic review in NLP
---

\* This post is a work in progress - I will add to it as I find out more things I don't know\*

Systematic reviews are being pushed by my institution, and seem like a good way of easing any doubts about the randomness of literature searches. However with little precedent in NLP, the process has been far from strightforward. Here I list the many doubts I have had and the decisions I've taken to resolve them.

### 1) Nobody does systematic reviews in NLP. Is there a good reason for this?

Systematic reviews seem like a good idea â€“ until you find out that almost nobody has done one in your field. The only one I've come across is

* Al-Moslmi, T., Omar, N., Abdullah, S. and Albared, M., 2017. Approaches to Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review. IEEE Access, 5, pp.16173-16192.

As a result I've had to cobble together my review protocol from a variety of sources in medicine, social sciences, and software engineering.

I've found the following to be useful:

* Boland, A., Cherry M.G., and Dickson, R., 2014. Doing a Systematic Review: a Student's Guide. Sage.
  This is SLR for Dummies, the go-to guidebook for those who don't know what they're doing. Written by medics, some of the stringent guidelines on e.g., getting two people to do each stage of the review can probably be relaxed if nobody's going to die as a result of your research.
* Petticrew, M. and Roberts H., 2006. Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences: a Practical Guide. Blackwell.
  This one's a bit older, but useful for the perspective from a field that doesn't involve clinical trials etc.
* Petersen, K., Vakkalanka, S. and Kuzniarz, L., 2015. Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: An update. Information and Software Technology, 64, pp.1-18.
  A systematic mapping study of systematic mapping studies, this is the sequel to another similar paper, and being from a branch of CS, probably closer to what I'm trying to achieve. 
  
### 2) Literature Review or Mapping Study, or something else?

I've spent a long time thinking about what type of review I'm doing, and I'm still not entirely sure. In the medical guidelines, the distinction is that a systematic literature review (SLR) focusses on results, whereas a systematic mapping study (SMS) is concerned with locating all the literature surrounding a topic and describing the associated meta-information, such as where and when the papers were published. 


### 3) Is it valid to use Google Scholar?

Yes and no. There is some debate about this, but if you want your search to be reproducible, then not really. However, I have used it for a scoping study, and to provide a list of databases to search. Which brings me to...


### 4) Databases and keyword searches

This is a massive pain. Every database has a different interface, requiring different input strategy, which can only be refined by painstaking trial and error.

### What to call it?


### Where to publish it?
