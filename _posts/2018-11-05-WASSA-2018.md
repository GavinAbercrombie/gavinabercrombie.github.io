title: WASSA and EMNLP 2018
---

Just back from presenting a paper on topic and opinion detection<sup>1</sup> at WASSA 2018 which was part of this years EMNLP, my fist time attending that, second at an ACL event and fourth overall big conference. 

Here are some thoughts.

<h2>Venue</h2>

Both the conference and the workshop took place at Square, a conference centre right in the centre of town. 
Considering the massive amount of attendees (c. 2,500), they didn't do to bad a job of organising everything 
Coffee break snacks were not up to LREC 2018 standards, but then that was Japan.

One area where organisation broke down a little was in the poster sessions â€“ more on that later.

The view from the 3rd floor:

Another thing was security, which noone seemed to be bothered about at any other conference I've been to. Here there were bag searches on every entry. I think this may be a Belgium thing.
