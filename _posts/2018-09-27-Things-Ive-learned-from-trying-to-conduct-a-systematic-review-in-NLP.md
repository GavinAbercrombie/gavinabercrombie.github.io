\* This post is a work in progress - I will add to it as I find out more things I don't know\*

Systematic reviews are being pushed by my institution, and seem like a good way of easing my doubts about the randomness of my literature searches. However with little precedent in NLP, the process has been far from strightforward. Here I list the many doubts I have had and the decisions I've taken to resolve them.

### 1) Nobody does systematic reviews in NLP. Is there a good reason for this?

Systematic reviews seem like a good idea â€“ until you find out that almost nobody has done one in your field. The only one I've come across is

* Al-Moslmi, T., Omar, N., Abdullah, S. and Albared, M., 2017. Approaches to Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review. IEEE Access, 5, pp.16173-16192.

As a result I've had to cobble together my review protocol from a variety of sources in medicine, social sciences, and software engineering.

I've found the following to be useful:

* Boland, A., Cherry M.G., and Dickson, R., 2014. Doing a Systematic Review: a Student's Guide. Sage.
* Petticrew, M. and Roberts H., 2006. Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences: a Practical Guide. Blackwell.

### 2) Is it valid to use Google Scholar?

Yes and no. There is some debate about this, but if you want your search to be reproducible, then not really. However, I have used it for a scoping study, and to provide a list of databases to search. Which brings me to...


### 3) Databases and keyword searches

This is a massive pain. Every database has a different interface, requiring different input strategy, which can only be refined by painstaking trial and error.
