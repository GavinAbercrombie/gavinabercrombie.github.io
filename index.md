I'm a PhD candidate in natural language processing at the University of Manchester, where I work on topic detection and sentiment analysis in parliamentary debates.

I'm now also a research associate at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, where I'm working on gender bias in conversational AI in [Verena Rieser's NLP lab](https://sites.google.com/view/nlplab/).
