I'm a PhD candidate in natural language processing at the University of Manchester, where I work on topic detection and sentiment analysis in parliamentary debates.

From September 2020, I'll be a research associate at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, where I'll be working on gender bias in conversational AI in [Verena Rieser's NLP lab](https://sites.google.com/view/nlplab/).
